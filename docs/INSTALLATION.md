# Installation

## Installation Options

The current Unison release is available for Mac OS X, 64-bit Linux, and Windows users! We hope that if you are trying out Unison you'll come talk to us in the Exercism slack or in the [Unison language slack](http://unison-lang.org/slack). Come ask questions, and report issues you might encounter! We want you to have a welcoming and positive experience when getting started! üòä

### Option 1: Using Homebrew

First [install homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if you haven‚Äôt already.

Then from the command line enter these commands:

```
brew tap unisonweb/unison
brew install unison-language
```

This will install the Unison codebase manager executable, `ucm`. If you‚Äôre upgrading from a previous version, just do

```
brew upgrade unison-language.
```

Note: if you get prompted for a GitHub username and password at this point, make sure you spelled unisonweb/unison correctly.

### Option 2: Install manually for Mac and Linux users

Linux:

```
mkdir unisonlanguage
curl -L https://github.com/unisonweb/unison/releases/download/release%2FM3/ucm-linux.tar.gz --output unisonlanguage/ucm.tar.gz
tar -xzf unisonlanguage/ucm.tar.gz -C unisonlanguage
./unisonlanguage/ucm
```

Mac:

```
mkdir unisonlanguage
curl -L https://github.com/unisonweb/unison/releases/download/release%2FM3/ucm-macos.tar.gz --output unisonlanguage/ucm.tar.gz
tar -xzf unisonlanguage/ucm.tar.gz -C unisonlanguage
./unisonlanguage/ucm
```

### Option 3: Install manually for Windows users

1. Set your default terminal application to ‚ÄúWindows Terminal‚Äù for best results. Search for ‚ÄúTerminal‚Äù in Settings, or follow [this how-to.](https://bit.ly/3IXwdlY)
2. If you‚Äôre not sure you already have it, install Git:
  * Via winget: `winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget`
  * If you are on Windows 10 and don‚Äôt have winget, you can install it from [the Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/app-installer/9nblggh4nns1), and then run the command above.
3. [Download the UCM with this link](https://github.com/unisonweb/unison/releases/download/release%2FM3/ucm-windows.zip) and extract it to a location of your choosing.
4. Run `ucm.exe`

### Option 4: Nix installation
Head to [https://github.com/ceedubs/unison-nix/#usage](https://github.com/ceedubs/unison-nix/#usage) and follow the instructions in the readme there.

## Create your Unison codebase

Run `ucm` to initialize a Unison codebase in `$HOME/.unison`. This is where Unison will store function definitions, types, namespaces, and so on. By default, the Unison Codebase Manger (abbreviated the "UCM")  will begin downloading the standard library, called `base`, which you'll use to write Unison code. It may take a moment! üï∞

## Unison workflow

When you want to write Unison code, you'll issue the `ucm` command to start the codebase manager. The UCM will then observe changes to any `.u` suffixed file in the directory where it is called from. For example, you might be implementing functions in a file called `scratch.u` in a directory called `~/exercism/unison/my-exercise/`. You should `cd` into `~/exercism/unison/my-exercise/` and run `ucm`. This will ensure that the UCM is watching your `scratch.u` file for changes.

If you're ever confused about what directory the `ucm` is watching for file changes under, it's printed in the welcome screen upon starting the cli.

```
üëÄ I'm watching for changes to .u files under /Users/myUser/exercism/unison/my-exercise
```

## Editor support

You can use any text editor to write your `.u` files. A few popular editors with Unison support are listed below:

### Vim

Using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

1. Install [`vim-plug`](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) if you haven't already.
2. Add the following to your .vimrc: `Plug 'unisonweb/unison', { 'branch': 'trunk', 'rtp': 'editor-support/vim' }`
3. Issue the vim command `:PlugInstall`.

For more information run `:help unison`
from within vim or view the [online help doc](https://github.com/unisonweb/unison/blob/trunk/editor-support/vim/doc/unison.txt).

### Atom
From the console, run:

```
apm install unisonweb/atom-unison
```

### VS Code

1. Bring up the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of VS Code, or with ‚áß‚åòX.
2. Search for "unison"
3. Select "Unison Syntax Highlighting" and click "Install."

### Emacs
Install [`unison-mode`](https://github.com/dariooddenino/unison-mode-emacs).
