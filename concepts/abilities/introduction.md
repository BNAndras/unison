# Introduction

Computational effects happen when a function relies on or changes something about its environment. Maybe it reads a file, or throws an exception, or sends data to another place. Abilities represent one of the ways in which a Unison program can manage these computational effects. An ability pairs an interface which describes an effect's operationsâ€”what it doesâ€”with handlers that dictate how the effect should actually be performedâ€”how it behaves. In programming literature they're known as "algebraic effects."

Unison's standard library contains a few commonly used abilities, which can be included in programs to represent error handling, global state, IO, and other useful effects.

```
divBy : Nat -> Nat ->{Abort} Nat
divBy a b =
  match b with
    0 -> Abort.abort
    n -> a / b
```

If a function performs an ability, you'll see it represent in curly braces, `{Abort}`, in the return type of the function.

## What are the benefits

Abilities are visible in the type signature of functions, so the effectful behavior of your program is still represented in the type system. A function can't secretly `throw` an exception or `emit` a value without an ability requirement appearing in the function signature, so you can reason about a program's behavior at the type level.

They support a separation of concerns between the purpose of an effect and how the effect is ultimately executed. This facilitates easy testing of effectful components and prevents the core of a program from being polluted with logic for managing the effect.

They allow for a coding style that is relatively free of boilerplate calls to `map` `flatMap` or other  "monadic plumbing ðŸª "â€”particularly where multiple effects are being performed at once.
