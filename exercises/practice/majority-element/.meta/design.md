# Design

## Goal

- The goal of this exercise is to practice tracking state while traversing a list

## Notes

- This exercise presents an opportunity to make use of the `Store` algebraic effect, the `State` monad, or `foldLeft`/`foldRight`. A variant of this exercise might also accept its arguments as a `Stream`.
- The tests of the exercise can be made to pass regardless of whether or not the student decides to use algebraic effectsâ€”they are implementation agnostic
