# Instructions append

- Bonus points: can you generalize your implementation to find the majority element of any type of List?
- Bonus points: is your implementation performant if there are many different elements to choose from when finding the majority?
- While you can implement the `majorityFinder` function in any way you choose, we've provided a few stubs which use the `Store` ability. You'll need to implement the `runWith` handler if you choose to use this ability. `runWith` returns both the result of running the function which uses the `Store` ability and the final state of the `Store`.
- You can read more about how ability handlers can track state in [the ability handler documentation][ability-handler-docs].
